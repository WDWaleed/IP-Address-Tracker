![Design preview for the IP address tracker coding challenge](/assets/Screenshot 2024-01-12 at 09-22-46 IP Address Tracker.png)

## Introduction
An IP Address Tracker that uses ipify's geo location API to fetch the data based on the IP Address provided. If no IP address is given in the API call then the client's IP address is used.

## PROBLEMS
Page Speed Insights has given the app a performance score of 57 and shows "!" for accessibility and best practices.
It says the problem is related to images which made me think that it must be related to the image tiles that are used to generate the map.

If you know a way to fix this issue or bring improvement to the performance, then open a pull request.
